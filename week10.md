In "Dying, Death, and the Aferlife in Human-Computer Interaction. A Scoping Review." authors Albers, Sadeghian, Laschke, and Hassenzahl explore the role of technology in aiding both the dying and the bereaved. Their research involved using the PRISMA method for scoping reviews (aka PRISMA-ScR) of existing literature to synthesize major ideas and identify key practices. Using this methodology, the team analyzed 107 relevant papers which they categorized into three main themes: digital remains, remembrance, and coping, to understand the effects of associated practices and how thanato-technology can support humans' emotional needs. Their study found that current thanato-technologies focus on enhancing the end-of-life experience by allowing dying individuals to curate their digital remains, while providing the bereaved with tools to maintain a connection with the deceased. However, these technologies primarily cater to the bereaved, overlooking other important aspects of a good death, such as spiritual wellbeing and empowering dying individuals in their end-of-life preparations.

I found this study incredibly interesting, not so much because of what they discovered, but rather due to the implications their findings might have for the future development of thanato-technologies. Personally, I have always viewed death as a very organic and emotional experience, meaning that it was not something I would typically have imagined technology making easier. However, when broken down by this study, I realized that a lot of the typical motions that people go through (though previously manual) have seen increasing degrees of tech mediums being incorporated. For example, photos and videos are now all online; similarly, with the advent of social media, people have more permanent presences via the web. This idea really reminds me of the Black Mirror episode "Be Right Back", which involved more advanced forms of thanato-technology (e.g building a real life replica of the deceased filled with knowledge gleaned from their online presence).
