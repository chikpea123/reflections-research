In "Enthusiastic and Grounded, Avoidant and Cautious: Understanding Public Receptivity to Data and Visualizations", researchers investigated open data initiatives, seeking to understand how individuals outside traditional data analysis communities interact with public data and visualizations. Through qualitative interviews involving 19 participants from diverse backgrounds, they explored data vis experiences related to energy consumption, production, and transmission. The study uncovered the concept of information receptivity, highlighting its significance alongside established notions of data visualization literacy and engagement. By identifying four distinct clusters of receptivity responses, namely Information-Avoidant, Data-Cautious, Data-Enthusiastic, and Domain-Grounded, the researchers shed light on the varied ways individuals engage with data and visualization-based rhetoric. Their findings not only unveiled new research avenues for the visualization community but also proposed strategies for enhancing the accessibility and inclusivity of open data initiatives for wider audiences.

After reading this study, I thought the experiment would've benefitted from a wider pool of participants. Since most people were from similar geographic locations, I felt that the liklihood of external factors influencing the data was quite high (e.g perhaps the local school systems emphasized the importance of energy-related topics). As such, interviewing people from a broader range of backgrounds may have resulted in a better representation of receptivity responses in the general population. Moreover, I think that (while the findings were interesting), this study suffers from the same sorts of issues as tests like the MBTI, where participants behaviors will change and result in various answers depending on what time they're asked. A potentially interesting long-term study might involve following certain participants from high school through maybe college to see if their behaviors change throughout their educational journey.
