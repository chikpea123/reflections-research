In their study titled "Understanding Food Planning Strategies of Food Insecure Populations: Implications for Food-Agentic Technologies," the research team investigated food insecure populations in Indiana by interviewing individuals from low- to middle-income backgrounds. Their aim was to explore how technology could enhance access to nutrition and promote equity. Their findings revealed that technology supports various aspects of food selection, purchase, and meal planning, such as finding discounts, searching for recipes, and sharing information. Additionally, the team proposed design suggestions to empower individuals in their food choices and identified three common shopping behaviors, offering corresponding design implications.

One particular facet I found interesting in their research was their use of identifying agency behaviors to help determine where technology could be implemented to assist. Though I've always been aware of many of the behaviors they listed, I had never really seen them mapped out and categorized like they did (e.g., high and low agency). As someone who has struggled over the summers to shop for food myself, seeing the behaviors in these categories helped me realize that some of the issues I had come across were major blockers and likely heavily impacted many of my dietary choices (e.g., being too far from the grocery store and ordering takeout more often). Moreover, as I looked at many of their findings from the study, I couldn't help but think that apps like Instacart should really consider adding more features to accommodate price scouting and other needs. An algorithm that can help shoppers find good sales on items and locate the best store for their given needs would probably be very popular. This functionality could also be extended to just an independent app designed for individuals to plan their shopping in a way that supports their financial, time, and dietary needs.
